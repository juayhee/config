# Platform binaries

## Linking
foo() implemented in other binary
- converted to a `call [address]` placeholder
    - this address is some area in a call table in the memory space
        - this table maps to where the real function location lives
        - GOT in linux, IAT in Windows


## Windows
.idata
contains names of libraries (stored in its own section)
each section also specifies which symbols to get from the library

no issues with [this](#interposition)

symbols cannot override each other

### Singletons
symbol for the singleton becomes per-binary
export the singleton varaible from shraed-lib and link all binaries against it

## Linux
.dynsym
ALL global symbols names for this binary
    - ones that need to be found by loader marked with "UND"
.dynamic
contains raw names of libraries

Symbol resolution: binaries ask loader to look for "UND" symbols from **ANY**
of the libraries in .dynamic
    - can lead to unexpected linking 

### Interposition
overriding of symbol in one binary from another binary
first definition shadows later definitions

### Library search order
when linker tries to resolve symbol by searching in libraries,
breadth first search down dependency tree
    - even across independent libraries on the same 'level'!

set LD_PRELOAD to ask linker to look there first

### Singletons
just put variable in exe

### Position Independent Code
`call [hardcoded address]` -> not independent, binary must be loaded at
specific address

example of PIEs: relative calls ie. relative to PC (only used for hidden symbols)

DEFAULT implementation: make call into GOT
    - only the code is independent but the GOT needs to be loaded into the same place
    - performance implication: calling a shared library symbol will indirect to GOT first
        - overhead like virtual function call
    - inlining not allowed
    - for default visibility symbol
        - this causes the [lazy binding](#lazy-binding)
    - **prefer compiling with -fvisibility=hidden to cut out the PLT middleman**

## C++
`new`
see standard [replacement.functions]
    - can override standard library functions this way

C++ on windows cannot do this

## Lazy Binding
delay resolution of symbols to time of first call instead of when loading binary
into memory
- default on on linux
    - intervene wiht `-no-plt`
    - means the address indicated for the symbol in GOT slot will have to
    **change at runtime** as well
    - implemented by following:
        1. function call to procedure_lookup_stub (list of all stubs is the PLT)
            - plt is per binary
        2. pls calls the GOT slot
        3. GOT slot jumps back to intstruction after (2)
        4. next instruction calls symbol resolver
        5. resolver gets the actual address of function
        (first call only, subsequent calls use the cached address from (5), which
        would have gone into the GOT slot)

- introduce new layer of indirection: call -> plt -> got -> plt+4 -> plt+8 -> got
    - high resolution overhead for all shared libraries

- default off on window
    - `/DELAYLOAD:<dll-to-lazy-bind>`


## General recommendations for shared libraries
- opt out of interposition
    - build with -fvisibility=hidden
    - mark exported functions (interface) explicitly
    - -Bsymbolic
