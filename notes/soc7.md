# The expression mirrors the syntax

[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8685514/why-is-the-dereference-operator-also-used-to-declare-a-pointer)

- [This] led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression
syntax in which the names typically appear

- In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an
expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.

## Examples
### An expression that would evaluate to an `int`
A variable `x`, when indexed, will give an int
`x[10]` gives an int

Corresponding declaration of x:
```
int x[10]
```
