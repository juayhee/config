# Terminal

## ANSI Escape Codes
[ANSI escape codes](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797)

Special escape sequences that, when sent to the terminal, will cause the terminal
to interpret them as **special characters** and execute specific functiionality.

### Typical use of escape codes
To emit ANSI sequences to terminal:
1. Be in a shell (ie. bash)
2. Ask the shell to emit the ANSI sequence
`echo -e '\033'` emits `[ESC]` to the terminal
    - note that `echo '\033'` means "print '\033' to the terminal
    - the `-e` flag tells echo to **interpret backslash escapes**
        - this means that `echo` will see '\033' as the ANSI `ESC` escape sequence
        - will emit `ESC` to the terminal instead of 'backslash zero three three'

## Tips

### Clear the scrollback buffer
`printf '\033[2J\033[3J\033[1;1H'`
