# debugging: back to basics

for a piece of code, test that it works or panic


## Tools
### GDB
- look into pretty printing with python
- debug foramt: DWARF 4

`layout source` - TUI mode
    - look into using GDB in TUI mode

`-g3`
    - Produces more detailed debug information / does not change program
`display` to render the value of the variable - good for arrays
`gdb dashboard` to show the stack, threads, variables

### LLDB
- similar to GDB

### Valgrind
memory checker
- is suite of tools
    - defaults to 'memcheck'
- no need to recompile code
- check for memory leaks

### Address sanitisers
compiler feature - **need to recompile** to produce new compile information
can spot the same things as valgrind
- faster at runtime than valgrind
- has different sanitisers
    - address sanitiser == valgrind memcheck
- can be added to CI

### libc++ debug mode
enables **assertions**


### strace/ltrace
system call tracing
`strace -k` can provide stacktraces even if no debug info
`pstack` can check the backtrace of a running process
    - wrapper over `gdb -p`
`ltrace` provides stacktraces into dynamically llinked libraries

### Time travel
- something about using reverse-step-i and gdb record - to look into the instruction
right before something went wrong
    - like a corrupted stack value
