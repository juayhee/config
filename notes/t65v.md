# Implementation sameness

## Traditional polymorphism
Being able to use the same interface at calling sites for different classes

## Templates
helps **implementation sameness**: functions that operate on different types
have the same code

## Implementation vs Interface sameness
for distinctly different concepts, the interface shouldn't be the same
but the implementation often is
    - eg. many classes use vectors and want to loop over their member vectors

**Do not mix the two!!**
focus on implementation sameness across classes

## Intrusive interfaces
interface difference with implementation sameness:
while the function names are different, but the kinds of things they do on
their parameters are generally the same

## Express implementation sameness
- must at the same time **minimise** interface sameness
    - functions that operate on a `Barnyard` class and a `Canvas` class must
    inherently be named differently, they are very different concepts
    - yet their underying implementations may use similar strucutres -> abstract these

- try to abstract away similar behaviour and **characteristics**
    - eg. a barnyard is a collection of animals / a canvas is a collection of shapes
    - should try and abstract away the fact that these collections are inherently
    **unordered**
        - make it easy for someone else to make the connection between the similarities
        in implementation

- examples of sameness that can be abstracted
    - both classes try and do elementwise comparisons
    - both classes use the same kinds of containers
    - both classes want to loop over data members to do something to them

- curiously recurring template pattern
    - introduce a general template class abstraction for sameness
    - have a 'customisation method' that allows users of the class to 'exhibit'
    their differences

- read up about mixins

## name forwarding
a member function that actually just delegates the function call to a member
eg. A.update() is implemented as A.B.update()

- name forwarding


## DRY
every piece of knowledge should have one representation / implementation
- think about where to **stop** and add customisation points -> points that users
of the class can 'branch off' and express their characteristics
- separate things reasonably
    - is separating an allocator and destructor for a class really wise?
    - allocators and destructors are **not separable pieces of knowledge**

## Concepts
- dangerous because it may _accidentally_ create code coupling
- concepts don't check namespaces
- can cause clashes
    - eg. interface sameness between a container and a class
    - if the concepts require the presence of an interface method...
        - what if the type is a container of class?
        - method name clashes
