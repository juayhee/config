# CTAD

Instead of having to specify the templte argument, can omit it and
rely on deduction guides in the definition
eg. fun<int>(1) vs. fun(1)
    - compiler will deduce that the template argument is <int>
    - help compiler with deduction guides


no ctad in pointers, references, arrays


implicit vs explicit deduction guides
    - don't rely on implicit guides generated by compiler
